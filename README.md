## About ##

Demano is a JQuery plugin to assist multiple filtering options on a page.  The general idea is that you create groups of filters and have a number of objects on the page that have CSS styles applied to them based on the filter selections.  See the [local demo](https://jsfiddle.net/mbaranski/q2rarzfn/ "Demano Example") for an example.

## Demos ##

There are 2 easy demos, to see this in action you can view the [lcoal demo](https://jsfiddle.net/mbaranski/q2rarzfn/ "Demano Example") or you can see an interactive demo at [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/mbaranski/q2rarzfn/ "JSFiddle Demano")

## Quickstart ##

`bower install demano` to install, then include `jquery.demano.js` in your script.  Make sure you also include JQuery.

Use demano by putting all your filters and filterable items inside a containing element with an id, and then do `$("#container_div_id").demano()`

That's it.

## Installation ##

`bower install demano`

Install however else you choose.  The only dependency is `jquery.demano.js` in the `js/main` directory of this repo.

## Usage ##

Demano filters act on groups of `filterable` elements.  Each element with the `filterable` class may also specify any `data-something` attributes with values to be filtered on.

Filters are created in groups, with each group filtering on a specific `data-` attribute.  For filters, a checkbox is created and given the following attributes:

* `data-attribute`
* `data-value`
* `data-group`

Filters with the same `data-group` are logical `OR` filters when multiple ones are selected.  Filters with different data groups can be though of as `AND` filters when filters from more than 1 group are selected.

The filter, when checked, will find all of the `filterable` elements with a matching attribute.  Giving multiple filters with the same group creates a logical `OR` condition.  That is, if 2 filters are created with `data-group="cats"`, `data-attribute="category"` and `data-value="Group 1"` for the first and `data-value="Group 2"` for the second, it would match all `filterable` elements that have `data-category=="Group 1" || data-category="Group 2"`.

    	<input
		  class="filter"
		  name="a"
		  data-attribute="category"
		  data-value="Group 1"
		  data-group="cats"
	 />
         <input
	         id="b"
	         class="filter"
	         type="checkbox"
	         name="b"
	         data-value="Group 2"
	 />
	<div class="filterable" data-category="Group 1"> a </div>
	<div class="filterable" data-category="Group 1"> b </div>
	<div class="filterable" data-category="Group 2"> c </div>

## Configuration Options
The following options are available.  Pass them as an object to the `demano` function, or use the (IMO) sensible default values

|Option | Values | Default Value | Description |
--------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| `filter_class` | String | `filter` | Class of the checkboxes that contain the filter definition |
| `filterable_class` | String | `filterable` | class of the checkboxes that are filtered |
| `attribute_name` | String | `attribute` | Name of the attribute that this filter uses to find the `filterable` attribute to search |
| `value_name` | String | `value`  | Value to match.  In other words, with `attribute_name` above this is what the attribute value equals |
| `group_name` | String | `group` | The group name of this filter to create logical `OR` conditions with other filters that have the same group |
| `toggle_class_matched` | String | `on` | Class to assign to `filterable` elements that are matches |
| `toggle_class_nomatched` | String | `off` | Class to assign to `filterable` elements that are not matches |
| `debug_element_id` | String | `null` | ID of an element to display the JSON value of the current filter state.  Helpful for debugging and defaults to `null`.  The [lcoal demo](https://jsfiddle.net/mbaranski/q2rarzfn/ "Demano Example") uses this feature |
